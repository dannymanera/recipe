  <h2>
    Ingredients:
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Wide slice sourdough bread (at least 7" wide)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    <li>2 small eggs</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  <h2>
    Steps:
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the bread slice on a cutting board. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 2 holes, side by side, in the bread. Make sure to leave bread between and around the holes.</li>
    <li>Put a skillet on the stove and switch on the heat to medium. Put the butter in the skillet.</li>
    <li>As the butter melts, spread it evenly on the bottom of the pan. Place the bread slice in the pan and break an egg into each hole. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on the eggs. Fry until the clear part of the eggs turn white, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slip a spatula under the bread and flip it over quickly but carefully. Don't let the eggs slip out of the holes. Cook for 1 minute more. Slide the toast onto a plate. Serve at once.</li>
  </ol>
